Data underlying Tables and Figures from the 2022 Perseus paper by de Vries et al. (arXiv link to follow)

The tables directory contains the direct latex code for each table in the paper <br>
Table 1: obsids.tex <br>
Table 2: sectors.tex <br>
Table 3: gf_params.tex <br>
Table 4: mcmc_results.tex <br>
Table 5: binomial.tex <br>


The figure_data contains table files that were used to generate the figures containing original data in the paper <br>
Figure 3: AGN_obs_v_predicted.dat <br>
Figure 4: ./model_visualizations/Mvis_N_sh[1-4].dat <br>
Figures 5 and 6: These are the same results as listed in mcmc_results.tex, so a separate .dat file was not generated <br>
Figure 7: tail_mc.dat <br>
Figure 8: PS_NE.dat <br>
Appendix A: the files in ./perseus_temp_apxA <br>
Appendix B: the files in ./model_visualizations/ <br>
